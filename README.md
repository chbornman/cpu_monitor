## Features

- üìä Real-time CPU usage monitoring for each core
- üé® Visual progress bars with percentage indicators
- üñ•Ô∏è Clean, minimal terminal interface
- üöÄ Efficient performance with minimal system impact
- ‚ö° Updates every second
- üçé Native macOS support (Including Apple Silicon)

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- GCC or Clang compiler

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpu_monitor.git
cd cpu_monitor
```

2. Compile the source:
```bash
gcc -o cpu_monitor cpu_monitor.c -framework IOKit -framework CoreFoundation
```

3. (Optional) Move the binary to your PATH:
```bash
sudo mv cpu_monitor /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

Simply run the compiled binary:
```bash
./cpu_monitor
```

The monitor will display:
- Individual CPU core utilization with visual bars
- Percentage values for each core
- Auto-updating display (1-second intervals)

To exit, press `Ctrl+C`.

## Technical Details

The monitor uses the following macOS frameworks and APIs:
- IOKit for system information
- CoreFoundation for property management
- Mach kernel APIs for CPU statistics
- ANSI escape codes for terminal visualization
